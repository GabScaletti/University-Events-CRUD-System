# University-Events-CRUD-System 🏦

This project consists of a single Python file that implements a university event management system. The system allows for creating, reading, updating, and deleting events, and also enables users to register for the desired event.

# 👣Steps of Development

During the development of the system, object-oriented programming practices were applied. The entire system is contained within a single Python file, featuring the following functionalities:
- Creation, reading, updating, and deletion of university events (CRUD);
- Registration of participants for the recorded events;
- Basic validation of user input;
- Terminal-based user interface with color formatting, allowing for easy interaction.

# 🛠️Used Tecnologies

- Python Language 3.11.9
- Data Structure: listas e classes;
- Conditional logic and loops;
- Modularization of functions for better visualization and organization.

# 📝Self-assessment
The technology used for data structure works momentarily, storing data in the memory allocated during software execution. A more efficient technology would be the manipulation of CSV files, due to their tabular data storage structure.
